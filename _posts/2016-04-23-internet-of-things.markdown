Devices communicate with internet of things platform which then analyses the
data and shares it with applications. 

In other words, internet of things is a software layer which acts as an aggregator for different api's of devices. On top of this software layer, applications are built to provide some extra functionality.

## Sub industries:


**Industrial Internet of Things**

It becomes easier and cheeaper to collect and analyze data. Anyone with some programming knowledge and time can order Raspberry Pi or Arduino and customize it to collect data from almost any device. This data then can be pipelined into some sort of a hub where it can be analyzed and displayed on a nice GUI. 

[Precisionhawk](http://www.precisionhawk.com/index.html?gclid=CP-9rJGPrcwCFcYfhgodYTMDPg) is a drone manufacturer that offers drones that are capable to collect all sorts of data that then can be analyzed on their cloud platform and display results in a nice format fot client to use and share.

**Smart Home**


**Areas of home that are targeted:**

* Security
	* Locks, Video cameras

* Entertainment
	* Music, Movies

* Temperature
	* Thermostats

* Electricity consumption monitoring
* Smart kitchen ware
* Sleep

We can divide all of the areas above into several categories:

* Entertainment

* Security

* Economy

* Health

* Decor



Basically, all of the things used in home are going smart.  



**Approaches:**

* Centralised: every device is talking to a center hub

* Decentralised: devices are in some sort of distributed system


**Problems:**

* Hard set-up 
* Hard managment
	* Many devices have to be set-up and operated through their own proprietary app


**Solutons**


**Hard managment** is addressed by standartising api of IoT devices and making it more open to use by other devices. 


**Trends:**

* Connecting devices directly to the internet

* Connecting devices to a phone through bluetooth


* [Push-button](http://www.wired.com/2015/02/ive-seen-future-phones-looks-lot-like-yo/)

You push a physical or software button that has pre-programmed instructions to accomplish a simple task.
For example to order a cleaner or bread, you can simply push a button. Amazon started producing customizable 
[AWS IoT buttons](http://www.wired.com/2016/05/aws-iot-dash/) in May of 2016.


**Solutions to simplify communication among devices:**

* Home kit by Apple

* Brillo by Google

* Weave by Google

* Amazon Echo







**Companies:**

[August:](http://august.com/)

* Provides smart lock for doors.

* August smart lock (ASL)
	* Uses bluetooth

* August connect (AC)
	* Get notification about opened doors and users who did this
	* Lock and open doors at distance
	* Share permission for opening doors (Owner, Gues, Others)

ASL -> AC -> Internet 

Integrates with nest


**Belkin WeMo Switches:**

* Open api
* On wall switches


**Philips Hue:**

* Cusmtomizable light bulbs
* Open api (allows other apps to use these functionalities)
* Needs hard wired hue hub
